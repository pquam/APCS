wholenumbers {

take first number of eacch element of list, if it isnt a number, disregard it.
}

numerator {

    find / in equations and take the number before the slash
    save numerators into array
}

denominator {

    seperate equation by spaces
    save denominators into an array
    check to see if denominators are the same
    (if not) {
    devide larger denominator by smaller denominator to get X
    multiply smaller fraction by X
}

Addition {


    add numerators
    if final numerator is larger than common denominator, devide numerator by denominator, add result to whole number
    take the % of numerator over denominator and use the remainder as the new numerator
    add whole numbers, including excess from fractions
    add fraction part onto the end
    return new fraction.
}

Subtraction {

    subtract numerator 1 from numerator 2
    if final numerator is larger than common denominator, devide numerator by denominator, add result to whole numbers
    take the % of numerator over denominator and use the remainder as the new numerator
   add excess from fractions to whole numbers, subtract whole numbers
    add fraction part onto the end
    return new fraction.
