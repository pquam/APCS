Addition {

    seperate equation by spaces
    check to see if denominator is the same
    (if not) {
    devide larger denominator by smaller denominator to get X
    multiply smaller fraction by X
    }
    add numerators
    if final numerator is larger than common denominator, devide numerator by denominator, add result to whole number
    take the % of numerator over denominator and use the remainder as the new numerator
    add whole numbers, including excess from fractions
    add fraction part onto the end
    return new fraction.
